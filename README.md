# Advent of Code

## Running Solutions

Solutions are sorted into subdirectories by year and then further by day. Each solution is a separate script; I may redo solutions in other languages to learn.

### Python

Python solutions are managed with `uv`. Any dependencies can be installed with `uv sync` and run with `uv run SCRIPT`.

I may change dependencies to in-line dependencies, we shall see.
